Of course. Here is a detailed analysis of your main.py file, focusing on refactoring instructions, issue-fixing steps, and recommended improvements to enhance code clarity and maintainability without breaking core functionality.

I. Found Issues & Fixing Approach

Your application is feature-rich, but the main.py file has become a "God object," handling too many responsibilities. This is the primary issue to address.

Massive File Size & Lack of Structure:

Issue: The file is over 1500 lines long, containing everything from application setup and UI rendering to API logic for TTS, sessions, and vocabulary. This makes the code hard to navigate, debug, and maintain.

Fixing Approach: The most impactful change is to break main.py into smaller, focused modules. A well-organized project structure will make development much smoother. I'll propose a new structure below.

Mixing of Concerns (UI vs. Logic):

Issue: Route handlers like get("/") and load_session are responsible for both business logic (fetching data) and UI generation (creating complex fasthtml component trees). This tight coupling makes both parts harder to change and test independently.

Fixing Approach:

Create UI Components: Isolate large blocks of UI-generating code into separate functions (e.g., render_main_layout, render_settings_modal). Place these in a new components/ directory.

Separate Route Logic: Keep route handlers (@rt(...)) lean. Their job should be to parse the request, call service functions for data/logic, and then call a UI component function to render the response.

JavaScript Embedded in Python Strings:

Issue: The polling safety mechanism script is a large multi-line string inside your Python code. This is not ideal for maintenance, syntax highlighting, or linting.

Fixing Approach: Move the JavaScript code to its own file (e.g., static/js/polling-manager.js) and include it in the main layout using <Script src="/static/js/polling-manager.js?v=4">.

Inconsistent API/Route Responses:

Issue: The style of response varies. For example, toggle-favorite correctly returns an HTML fragment for HTMX to swap, while rename-session returns JSON. delete-session on error returns a simple Div, which might not be what the frontend expects.

Fixing Approach: Standardize your responses. For actions triggered via HTMX that update a part of the page, returning an HTML fragment (even for errors) is best. For endpoints designed to be called programmatically via JS, consistently return JSONResponse.

II. Step-by-Step Refactoring Instructions

I recommend applying these changes incrementally, testing after each major step.

Step 1: Create a More Organized Project Structure

Restructure your project to separate concerns. This is a foundational change.

│   └── ...
└── ...                  # (Other existing folders like static, config, etc.)

Step 2: Create Reusable UI Components

Create the components/ directory.

Create components/layout.py.

Move the entire giant Div(...) from the get("/") route into a function render_main_layout() inside components/layout.py.

Break down render_main_layout further into smaller functions within the same file or other component files (e.g., render_left_sidebar, render_right_sidebar, render_settings_modal).

Move render_session_list from main.py into components/sidebars.py.

Example: components/layout.py

Generated python
# components/layout.py
from fasthtml.common import *
from .sidebars import render_session_list
# ... import other components

def render_main_layout(sessions, filter_params, current_session_id):
    # This function will now contain the large Div from your original get("/")
    return Div(
        # ... a lot of UI code ...
        # Instead of defining the session list here, you call the component:
        render_session_list(sessions, filter_params, current_session_id),
        # ... more UI code ...
    )

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
Step 3: Separate Route Handlers

Create the routes/ directory and the Python files within it.

In main.py, keep the app, rt = fast_app(...) initialization.

Move the route functions (@rt(...)) from main.py into the appropriate files in the routes/ directory.

Example: routes/session_routes.py

Generated python
# routes/session_routes.py
from fasthtml.common import *
from main import rt # Import the 'rt' object from your main file
from utils.response_helpers import ...
from services.session_service import ... # You'll create this next

@rt("/load-session/{session_id}")
async def load_session(session_id: str):
    # ... logic for loading a session ...

@rt("/save-session", methods=["POST"])
async def save_session(request):
    # ... logic for saving a session ...

# ... other session-related routes ...
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

In your main main.py file, import these new route modules to ensure the routes are registered with the app.

Example: main.py (after refactoring)

Generated python
# main.py
from fasthtml.common import *
# ... other initial imports ...

# --- App Initialization ---
# Keep the app and rt setup here
app, rt = fast_app(...)

# --- Import Routes to Register Them ---
from routes import ui_routes, session_routes, tts_routes, vocabulary_routes

# ... any other top-level setup ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    serve(host='127.0.0.1', port=5001)

Use code with caution.
Python
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
Step 4: Extract Business Logic into Services

Create the services/ directory.

Create services/tts_service.py.

Move the function _generate_tts_response into this new file. Rename it to something like generate_tts_audio. This function should only be concerned with the logic of generating audio and timing data, not creating an HTML Div. It should return data (e.g., a dictionary or a data class) or raise an exception on failure.

Example: services/tts_service.py

Generated python
# services/tts_service.py
import base64
from tts import TTSFactory
from utils.response_helpers import convert_timings_to_word_data, save_timestamps_json
from utils.text_helpers import extract_pinyin_for_characters
# ... other imports ...

async def generate_tts_audio(text: str, voice: str, speed: float, volume: float, engine: str):
    """
    Generates TTS audio and returns structured data.
    Raises an exception on failure.
    """
    try:
        tts_engine = TTSFactory.create_engine(engine)
        audio_data, word_timings = await tts_engine.generate_speech(text, voice, speed, volume)
        
        word_data = convert_timings_to_word_data(word_timings)
        audio_base64 = base64.b64encode(audio_data).decode()
        pinyin_data = extract_pinyin_for_characters(text)
        json_file_path = save_timestamps_json(word_data)
        
        return {
            "audio_base64": audio_base64,
            "word_data": word_data,
            "pinyin_data": pinyin_data,
            "text": text,
            "json_file_path": json_file_path
        }
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"TTS Generation Failed in service: {e}")
        raise  # Re-raise the exception to be handled by the route
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Your route handler generate_custom_tts would then call this service and handle rendering the success or error response.

III. Specific Issue Fixing Steps

Here are fixes for smaller, specific issues in your code.

Simplify filter-sessions Request Parsing:

Issue: The logic to get parameters from GET or POST is complex.

Fix: Create a helper function to parse filter parameters from the request, abstracting away the method.

Generated python
# In utils/text_helpers.py or a new request_helpers.py
async def parse_session_filter_params(request):
    params = {}
    # Form data takes precedence
    if request.method == "POST":
        form_data = await request.form()
        params.update(form_data)
    
    # Fallback to query parameters
    query_params = getattr(request, 'query_params', {})
    for key, val in query_params.items():
        if key not in params:
            params[key] = val

    # Normalize and validate
    show_favorites = str(params.get('favorites', 'false')).lower() in ['true', '1', 'on']
    search_text = params.get('search', '').strip()[:100]

    return {'show_favorites': show_favorites, 'search_text': search_text}

Improve delete-session Logic:

Issue: get_sessions() is called twice. The error response is a simple Div.

Fix: Call get_sessions() once. For the error case, you can return a more informative HTML fragment that HTMX can still swap into the target.

Generated python
# In routes/session_routes.py
@rt("/delete-session/{session_id}", methods=["DELETE"])
async def delete_session(session_id: str):
    try:
        # ... (your existing deletion logic) ...
        # Call get_sessions() only once after deletion
        remaining_sessions = get_sessions()
        # ... (your logic to find next session to select) ...
        return render_session_list(remaining_sessions, {}, auto_select_session_id)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error deleting session {session_id}: {str(e)}")
        # Return an error message that fits in the session list
        return Div(
            "Error deleting session. Please refresh.",
            id="sessions-list", # Ensure the target ID matches
            cls="text-red-500 p-4"
        )

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Encapsulate Session Metadata Logic:

Issue: The functions for managing session_metadata.json are loosely defined in main.py.

Fix: Create a class to manage this, improving encapsulation.

Generated python
# In a new file, e.g., services/session_service.py
class SessionMetadataManager:
    def __init__(self, file_path):
        self.file_path = Path(file_path)
        self.metadata = self._load()

    def _load(self):
        if not self.file_path.exists():
            return {}
        try:
            with open(self.file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                return json.load(f)
        except (json.JSONDecodeError, IOError):
            return {}

    def _save(self):
        # Use your existing atomic save logic here
        # ...

    def update_metadata(self, session_id, **updates):
        # ... (your existing update logic) ...
        self._save()

Use code with caution.
Python
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Make rename-session HTMX-Friendly:

Issue: It returns JSON, which is inconsistent with other UI-updating routes.

Fix: Return an updated sessions-list fragment using an Out-of-Band (OOB) swap, just like toggle-favorite does. This provides a better user experience as the UI updates automatically.

Generated python
# In routes/session_routes.py
@rt("/rename-session/{session_id}", methods=["POST"])
async def rename_session(session_id: str, request):
    # ... (logic to get new_name and update metadata) ...
    
    # Re-render the session list and send it back
    sessions = get_sessions()
    # Find the currently active session to maintain the 'active' highlight
    form_data = await request.form()
    current_session_id = form_data.get('current_session_id', session_id)

    # Return the entire updated list for HTMX to swap
    return render_session_list(sessions, {}, current_session_id)

You would need to change the hx-target on the frontend from whatever handles the JSON to #sessions-list.
