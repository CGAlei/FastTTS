> in case code is broken how to restore

‚óè Here are the exact steps to restore your FastTTS when code is broken:

  üö® Emergency Restoration Guide

  Option 1: Full Restore (Recommended)

  When everything is broken and you want to go back to last working state:

>   # 1. Stop the FastTTS server (Ctrl+C if running)
> 
>   # 2. Rename broken version (for safety)
>   mv /mnt/d/FastTTS /mnt/d/FastTTS_broken_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
> 
>   # 3. Restore from emergency backup
>   cp -r /mnt/d/FastTTS_Backups/Emergency/Last_Known_Good /mnt/d/FastTTS
> 
>   # 4. Restart server
>   cd /mnt/d/FastTTS
>   python main.py

  Option 2: Code-Only Restore

  When only code files are broken but sessions are fine:

  # 1. Stop the server

  # 2. Backup current sessions (if they're good)
  cp -r /mnt/d/FastTTS/sessions /tmp/current_sessions_backup

  # 3. Restore main code file
  cp /mnt/d/FastTTS_Backups/Emergency/Last_Known_Good/main.py /mnt/d/FastTTS/

  # 4. Restore static files
  cp -r /mnt/d/FastTTS_Backups/Emergency/Last_Known_Good/static /mnt/d/FastTTS/

  # 5. Restore sessions if needed
  cp -r /tmp/current_sessions_backup /mnt/d/FastTTS/sessions

  # 6. Restart server

  Option 3: Specific File Restore

  When only one file is broken:

  # Restore just main.py
  cp /mnt/d/FastTTS_Backups/Emergency/Last_Known_Good/main.py /mnt/d/FastTTS/

  # Or restore specific JS file
  cp /mnt/d/FastTTS_Backups/Emergency/Last_Known_Good/static/js/audio-player.js
  /mnt/d/FastTTS/static/js/

  # Or restore specific CSS file
  cp /mnt/d/FastTTS_Backups/Emergency/Last_Known_Good/static/css/main.css /mnt/d/FastTTS/static/css/     

  Option 4: Choose Different Backup

  If you want to go back to a specific date:

  # List available backups
  ls -la /mnt/d/FastTTS_Backups/Daily/
  ls -la /mnt/d/FastTTS_Backups/Major_Versions/

  # Restore from specific daily backup
  cp -r /mnt/d/FastTTS_Backups/Daily/2025-06-16_FastTTS /mnt/d/FastTTS_restored

  # Then rename it
  mv /mnt/d/FastTTS /mnt/d/FastTTS_broken
  mv /mnt/d/FastTTS_restored /mnt/d/FastTTS

  Quick Recovery (30 seconds)

  For immediate safety when something goes wrong:

  # One-liner full restore
  mv /mnt/d/FastTTS /mnt/d/FastTTS_broken && cp -r /mnt/d/FastTTS_Backups/Emergency/Last_Known_Good      
  /mnt/d/FastTTS

  Check What's in Backup

  Before restoring, see what's in the backup:

  # List backup contents
  ls -la /mnt/d/FastTTS_Backups/Emergency/Last_Known_Good/

  # Check backup info
  cat /mnt/d/FastTTS_Backups/Emergency/Last_Known_Good/BACKUP_INFO.txt

  # Compare main.py files
  diff /mnt/d/FastTTS/main.py /mnt/d/FastTTS_Backups/Emergency/Last_Known_Good/main.py

  After Restoration

  1. ‚úÖ Test that the server starts: python main.py
  2. ‚úÖ Test that sessions load properly
  3. ‚úÖ Test karaoke functionality works
  4. ‚úÖ Create new emergency backup: /mnt/d/backup_fasttts.sh emergency
