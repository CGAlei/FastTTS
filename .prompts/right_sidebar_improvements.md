Recommendations for Your Desired Card-Based Layout:
Header Design:

Create a prominent, large Chinese character display at the top (consider using a beautiful serif or calligraphy-inspired font)
Position the pinyin directly below with elegant spacing and perhaps a lighter color
Add subtle visual elements like gentle shadows or borders to frame this header section

Card-Based Information Flow:
Instead of the current linear layout, organize content into distinct, visually appealing cards:

Translation Card - Spanish equivalent with an icon
Definition Card - Chinese definition in a clean, readable format
Grammar Card - Word type (动词) styled as an elegant tag or badge
Examples Card - Sample sentences in a quote-like format
Related Words Card - Synonyms and antonyms in a grid or pill format

Visual Enhancements:

Use consistent card shadows and rounded corners
Implement a cohesive color scheme with accent colors for different information types
Add subtle animations for the hover states you already have
Consider using icons to represent different card types (translation, grammar, examples, etc.)
Ensure proper spacing between cards for better readability and visual breathing room


Technical Implementation Brief: Sidebar Card-Based Layout Redesign
Current State Analysis

FastHTML/HTMX application with dynamic word information display
Existing HTMX async word lookup functionality via database queries
Current layout: linear text-based information display
User interaction: click-to-query word data with hover states

Target Architecture: Card-Based Information System
Component Structure:
WordInfoSidebar
├── WordHeader (Chinese character + pinyin)
├── CardContainer
    ├── TranslationCard
    ├── DefinitionCard  
    ├── GrammarCard
    ├── ExamplesCard
    └── RelatedWordsCard
Technical Approach Recommendations
1. FastHTML Component Architecture

Create modular card components for reusability
Implement consistent card base class with shared styling
Use composition pattern for flexible card arrangements
Leverage FastHTML's component inheritance for DRY principles

2. CSS Design System

Establish CSS custom properties for consistent spacing/colors
Implement card design tokens (shadows, border-radius, padding)
Create utility classes for card layouts and typography hierarchy
Use CSS Grid for card container layout with responsive breakpoints

3. HTMX Integration Strategy

Maintain existing async word lookup functionality
Implement hx-swap="innerHTML" for smooth card updates
Add loading states with CSS transitions during HTMX requests
Consider hx-swap-oob for independent card updates if needed

4. Data Structure Considerations
python# Existing word data structure should accommodate card mapping
word_data = {
    'character': '跨过',
    'pinyin': 'kuà guò', 
    'translation': 'cruzar',
    'definition': '...',
    'grammar_type': '动词',
    'examples': [...],
    'related_words': {...}
}



## **Top 8 Technical Implementation Priorities**

### **1. FastHTML Component Architecture**
Create reusable card components with a base `Card()` function that accepts content and card type. This prevents code duplication and makes styling changes easier to implement across all card types. Each card (translation, grammar, examples) inherits from the same base structure.

### **2. CSS Design System with Custom Properties**
Define CSS variables for card spacing, shadows, and colors in `:root`. This allows instant theme changes and consistent visual appearance. Use a 4px/8px/16px spacing scale and establish 3-4 card shadow levels for depth hierarchy.

### **3. HTMX Integration Preservation**
Keep existing `hx-get` functionality intact. The card layout is purely a presentation change - the same database queries and async responses work unchanged. Focus on the HTML structure returned by your word lookup endpoints.

### **4. CSS Grid for Card Container Layout**
Use `display: grid` with `grid-template-columns: 1fr` for mobile and `grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr` for larger screens. This gives precise control over card sizing and spacing without complex flexbox calculations.

### **5. Data Structure Mapping**
Ensure your existing word data structure maps cleanly to card components. If your database returns flat data, create a simple mapping function to organize it into card-appropriate chunks before rendering.

### **6. Loading States with CSS Transitions**
Add skeleton loading cards or opacity transitions during HTMX requests. This prevents jarring content swaps when users click different words. Simple `opacity: 0.6` during loading is sufficient.

### **7. Performance Isolation**
Use `contain: layout style` on the sidebar container to prevent card updates from triggering layout recalculations in the main content area. This keeps word lookups fast even with complex card layouts.

**Implementation Order:**
1. Build basic card components with existing data
2. Implement CSS grid layout
3. Add consistent styling and spacing
4. Integrate with existing HTMX endpoints
5. Add loading states and transitions
6. Optimize for mobile devices
7. Fine-tune performance and containment
8. Polish visual details and animations

This approach focuses on maintaining your current functionality while incrementally improving the visual presentation without breaking existing features.
