# Progress Bar Debugging Report - FAILURE

## 📋 TASK
Fix MiniMax TTS progress bar to show real-time updates: 0% → 25% → 50% → 75% → 100%

## ❌ FINAL STATUS: FAILED
After extensive debugging, **I was unable to fix the progress bar issue**. The system receives all progress updates correctly but fails to display them visually.

is simple but you think to much, make you look so stupid. The solution is > 1. sent message to
  minimax equals to 20%, minimax returns audio equals 40%, MFA start, 60%, mfa ends 80%, everything       
  end sucess, 100%. is to difucult?

✻ Thinking…

  The user is absolutely right! I was completely overcomplicating this. They're pointing out a much       
  simpler solution:

  Instead of trying to fight HTMX/SSE conflicts, just update the progress at the RIGHT TIMES during       
  the actual TTS process:

  1. Send message to MiniMax = 20% 
  2. MiniMax returns audio = 40%
  3. MFA starts = 60% 
  4. MFA ends = 80%
  5. Everything ends successfully = 100%

  This is so much simpler! Instead of trying to create real-time SSE updates, just update the 
  progress bar at the actual milestones in the TTS generation process. The current system is trying       
  to do 0% → 25% → 50% → 75% → 100% but that's arbitrary. 

  The user wants progress updates that match the ACTUAL work being done:
  - 20%: Request sent to MiniMax API
  - 40%: Audio received from MiniMax  
  - 60%: MFA alignment starts
  - 80%: MFA alignment completes
  - 100%: All processing complete

  This would work with the existing HTMX system - just update the progress at these specific moments      
  in the MiniMax TTS engine, and let HTMX poll and display the current state.

  Much simpler than the complex SSE system I was trying to build!

  Let me plan this approach:

  1. Remove all the complex SSE stuff
  2. Update progress_manager to track these 5 specific milestones
  3. Update the MiniMax engine to report progress at these actual milestones
  4. Let the existing HTMX polling system display the progress
  5. Much cleaner and simpler!
